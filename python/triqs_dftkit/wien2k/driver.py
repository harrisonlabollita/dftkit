"""
WIEN2k driver for TRIQS+DFT workflow automation.

This module provides a driver class for automating WIEN2k calculations in the
context of charge self-consistent (CSC) DMFT calculations with TRIQS/modest.

Unlike VASP (one persistent forked process) or Quantum ESPRESSO (one executable
per step), WIEN2k is a *chain* of Fortran programs -- lapw0, lapw1, lapw2, lcore,
mixer -- each launched through the ``x`` tcsh script, which writes the ``.def``
file of unit -> filename assignments that the program reads.  The SCF loop that
normally drives them lives in the ``run_lapw`` tcsh script.

This driver replaces ``run_lapw``: it owns the loop in Python so that modest's
DftDriver can inject a DMFT charge density correction between iterations.
WIEN2k's own QDMFT support cannot be reused because it inverts the control flow
-- ``run_lapw`` calls out to a user python script from inside its cycle, whereas
DftDriver requires python to be the caller.

Scope: serial, non-magnetic (SP=0, SO=0).  ``lapw2 -qdmft`` cannot be run in
parallel at all: the entire DMFT code path is inside ``#ifndef Parallel`` in
SRC_lapw2/qdmft.F and is therefore compiled out of ``lapw2_mpi``.  Independently,
its k-point counter is process-local while the density matrix array is indexed
globally, so k-point parallelism is broken too.

    Attributes
    ----------
    seedname : str
        WIEN2k case name.  All WIEN2k files are ``<seedname>.<ext>`` and the
        archive modest reads is ``<seedname>.h5``.

        WIEN2k installation directory; ``<wienroot>/x`` launches every program.
    dmftproj_exe : str
        The dmftproj executable.  Looked up on $PATH by default, matching how
        run_lapw invokes it.
    max_scf_iter : int
        Iteration cap for the initial SCF loop.
    ecut, ccut : float
        Energy (Ry) and charge convergence limits, as run_lapw's -ec and -cc.
    verbosity : int
