"""
WIEN2k driver for TRIQS+DFT workflow automation.

This module provides a driver class for automating WIEN2k calculations in the
context of charge self-consistent (CSC) DMFT calculations with TRIQS/modest.

WIEN2k is a *chain* of Fortran programs -- lapw0, lapw1, lapw2, lcore,
mixer -- each launched through the ``x`` tcsh script, which writes the ``.def``
file of unit -> filename assignments that the program reads.  The SCF loop that
normally drives them lives in the ``run_lapw`` tcsh script.

This driver replaces ``run_lapw``: it owns the loop in Python so that modest's
DftDriver can inject a DMFT charge density correction between iterations.
WIEN2k's own QDMFT support cannot be reused because it inverts the control flow
-- ``run_lapw`` calls out to a user python script from inside its cycle, whereas
DftDriver requires python to be the caller.

Scope: serial, non-magnetic (SP=0, SO=0).  ``lapw2 -qdmft`` cannot be run in
parallel at all.

    Driver orchestrating the WIEN2k program chain for CSC DFT+DMFT.

    Satisfies modest's DftDriver contract: it exposes ``seedname``,
    ``run_initial_stage`` and ``run_update_stage``, and leaves
    ``<seedname>.h5`` fully re-converted before either hook returns.

    Attributes
    ----------
    seedname : str
        WIEN2k case name.  All WIEN2k files are ``<seedname>.<ext>`` and the
        archive modest reads is ``<seedname>.h5``.
    wienroot : str
        WIEN2k installation directory; ``<wienroot>/x`` launches every program.
    dmftproj_exe : str
        The dmftproj executable.  Looked up on $PATH by default, matching how
        run_lapw invokes it.
    max_scf_iter : int
        Iteration cap for the initial SCF loop.
    ecut, ccut : float
        Energy (Ry) and charge convergence limits, as run_lapw's -ec and -cc.
    verbosity : int
        0 -- warnings only; 1 -- also per-cycle convergence and restart messages
        (default); 2 -- also one line per WIEN2k program launched.  Output is
        written on the master rank only.  Settable at any time as an attribute.

    Notes
    -----
    ``wienroot`` and ``dmftproj_exe`` are the only coupling to WIEN2k, so a fake
    WIEN2k can be substituted for testing by pointing them elsewhere.
