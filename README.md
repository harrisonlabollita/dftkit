# triqs_dftkit - A skeleton for a TRIQS application

Initial Setup
-------------

To adapt this skeleton for a new TRIQS application, the following steps are necessary:

* Create a repository, e.g. https://github.com/username/appname

* Run the following commands in order after replacing **appname** accordingly

```bash
git clone https://github.com/triqs/triqs_dftkit --branch python_only appname
cd appname
./share/squash_history.sh
./share/replace_and_rename.py appname
git add -A && git commit -m "Adjust triqs_dftkit skeleton for appname"
```

You can now add your github repository and push to it

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/appname
git remote update
git push origin unstable
```

If you prefer to use the [SSH interface](https://help.github.com/en/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
to the remote repository, replace the http link with e.g. `git@github.com:username/appname`.

### Merging triqs_dftkit skeleton updates ###

You can merge future changes to the triqs_dftkit skeleton into your project with the following commands

```bash
git remote update
git merge triqs_dftkit_remote/python_only -X ours -m "Merge latest triqs_dftkit skeleton changes"
```

If you should encounter any conflicts resolve them and `git commit`.
Finally we repeat the replace and rename command from the initial setup.

```bash
./share/replace_and_rename.py appname
git commit --amend
```

Now you can compare against the previous commit with: 
```bash
git diff prev_git_hash
````

Getting Started
---------------

After setting up your application as described above you should customize the following files and directories
according to your needs (replace triqs_dftkit in the following by the name of your application)

* Adjust or remove the `README.md` and `doc/ChangeLog.md` file
* In the `python/triqs_dftkit` subdirectory add your Python source files.
* In the `test/python` subdirectory adjust the example test `Basic.py` or add your own tests.
* Adjust any documentation examples given as `*.rst` files in the doc directory.
* Adjust the sphinx configuration in `doc/conf.py.in` as necessary.
* The build and install process is identical to the one outline [here](https://triqs.github.io/triqs_dftkit/unstable/install.html).

### Optional ###
----------------

* Add your email address to the bottom section of `Jenkinsfile` for Jenkins CI notification emails
